cbc: COIN-OR branch and cut solver for mixed-integer programs
=============================================================

Description
-----------

The Computational Infrastructure for Operations Research (COIN-OR**, or
simply COIN) project is an initiative to spur the development of
open-source software for the operations research community.

The COIN Branch and Cut solver (CBC) is an open-source mixed-integer
program (MIP) solver written in C++. CBC is intended to be used
primarily as a callable library to create customized branch-and-cut
solvers. A basic, stand-alone executable version is also available. CBC
is an active open-source project led by John Forrest at www.coin-or.org.
