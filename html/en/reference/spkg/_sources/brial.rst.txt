brial: Boolean Ring Algebra implementation using binary decision diagrams
=========================================================================

Description
-----------

BRiAl ("Boolean Ring Algebra") is the successor to PolyBoRi.

The core of PolyBoRi is a C++ library, which provides high-level data
types for Boolean polynomials and monomials, exponent vectors, as well
as for the underlying polynomial rings and subsets of the powerset of
the Boolean variables. As a unique approach, binary decision diagrams
are used as internal storage type for polynomial structures. On top of
this C++-library we provide a Python interface. This allows parsing of
complex polynomial systems, as well as sophisticated and extendable
strategies for Gröbner base computation. PolyBoRi features a powerful
reference implementation for Gröbner basis computation.
