<p>SuiteSparse is a collection of software to deal with sparse matrix. It is
hosted at <a class="reference external" href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html</a></p>
<p>This spkg does a minimal install of suitesparse disabling the following</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>metis</p></li>
<li><p>GraphBLAS (need cmake)</p></li>
<li><p>Mongoose (need cmake)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An external metis package can be used but we just disable its use.</p>
<p>Patches:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The first patch disable the building of package using cmake.</p></li>
<li><p>The second patch make sure we use sage’s blas/lapack on OS X. By
default
suitesparse discard any configurations to use the accelerate framework.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The building of metis is diabled by passing MY_METIS_LIB=none to make
(any value would have done) We also configure cholmod so it doesn’t
require metis by passing CHOLMOD_CONFIG=-DNPARTITION to make.</p>
<p>Other configurations are self explanatory.</p>
<p>License: because SuiteSparse is a collection, it comes with a variety of
licenses. Find below a copy of the “LICENSES.txt” shipped with
SuiteSparse.</p>
